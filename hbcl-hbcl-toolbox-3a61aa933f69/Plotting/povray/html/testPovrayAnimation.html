%% This script uses an external program called povray to create beautiful renderings
% of things in 3 dimensions. This might be useful if you want to show an
% animation of a prosthetic foot operating in 3d, or a 3d walking model. It
% is more annoying to use than matlab's 3d plotting, but the results can
% look pretty good, and this can help the viewer's understanding of what is
% going on, since humans are used to using cues like shadows and such when
% parsing 3d data from an observed two dimensional image.
% 
% what the functions in this folder do is stuff like:
% write a .pov file (which contains code in let's call it 
% the "povray language"). 
% call pvengine.exe, with the .pov file, which results in a .png.
% assemble the .pngs into .avis
%
% All geometry to be rendered in povray must be specified as povray code.
% This library only draws rigid bodies, which each have a position and an
% orientation. The main .pov file, written by this function, passes
% position and orientation data to sub-povray .inc files, each of which defines
% the actual geometry associated with a rigid body. So you could have a 3
% link walking model, with 2 legs and 1 pelvis. You would have to create,
% all on your lonesome, 2 files: leg.inc, and pelvis.inc, which each define 
% an eponymous macro (see Body.inc for an example that you should 
% just copy and paste). The macro must have 12 inputs (rotation-scale matrix,

% triangles in, say, your leg.inc file with the triangles from your wrl.
% 
% You could then create PovRayBodys specifying the location of those .inc files, 
% and then you can create a PovRayRenderer, and use it to render the
% bodies. A PovRayBody is also a RigidBody, so it has settable position and
% orientation vectors, so you can move them around in between frame
% renderings.
% 
% you can then use the more general function combineImageFilesIntoVideo to
% create an avi from the images.

%% Some things you will need to do to use the plotting routines in
% hbclToolbox\Plotting\povray:
% 
% install povray: download the installer from somewhere like
% http://www.povray.org/download/
% and run it. I have always agreed at the end to download and install the
% editor dlls as well.
% 
% if you are going to model your geometry in some 3d modelling program, 
% you'll want to install the contents of xroads1.zip in this folder.
% However, I found that it didn't want to work on 64bit windows 7, but it
% did work in a virtual machine running a 32bit windows xp. So that's the
% setup I advise.
% The tool is very old and probably defunct, but it worked for me. Here's

%% To set up povray for use with this matlab interface, you will want to change a 
% few options inside povray. The matlab works by opening an instance of
% povray for each frame to be rendered (this was easier than figuring out
% how to read data from a file into povray and render out frames with one
% instance). I recommend a few things:
%
% run povray
%
% go to Render -> sound settings... -> uncheck the boxes
% this will keep povray from annoying you with sound each frame (optional)
%
% go to options -> UNCHECK "keep single instance"
% this lets you run a bunch of povray renders in parallel (required?)
% 
% go to Render -> On completion -> Exit povray for windows
% This is so when you render a bunch of frames you don't have hundreds of
% povray instances hanging around (optional?)
%
% in the upper left corner, you should see a dropdown box saying something
% like:
% 320x240, No AA
% or some resolution followed by some anti aliasing spec. This is where you
% specify the output properties for your rendering. If you want to do a
% quick, low quality render, you can set that here, or when you're happy
% with the geometry, cameras, lighting, etc, you can crank the resolution
% up to whatever you want. If you're running this script just as a test, I
% would leave it on some low resolution for speed.

projectsDirectory = 'C:/Users/jrebula/myProjects/';
addpath(genpath([projectsDirectory 'HBCL Gait Analysis Toolbox v1.3/']));

%% define a body:
includeFile = 'exampleFiles/Body.inc';
body = PovRayBody(includeFile);

%% create a renderer:
renderer = PovRayRenderer();

%% generate some images, translating and rotating the body around a bit:
frameRate = 30;
tEnd = 2;
ts = 0 : 1/frameRate : tEnd;
imageFilenames = cell(1, length(ts));
for i = 1 : length(ts)
  t = ts(i);
  %   body.orientation = body.orientation + [0.1 0.1 -0.05]';
  %   body.orientation = [t*1*pi, t*1*pi, t*1*pi]';
  body.orientation = [t*1*pi, 0, 0]';
  body.position = [cos(t*2*pi) 3 * cos(t*2*pi), 3 * sin(t*2*pi)]' * 0.01;
  imageFilename = sprintf('./exampleFiles/test%g.png', i);
  imageFilenames{i} = imageFilename;
  renderer.render({body}, imageFilename);
end

%% combine those images into an avi
aviFilename = 'exampleFiles/testVideo.avi';
video = combineImagesIntoVideo(imageFilenames, aviFilename, frameRate);
